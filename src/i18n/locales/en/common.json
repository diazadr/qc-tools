  "q1": "What is a Check Sheet?",
  "a1": "A Check Sheet is a structured QC table used to collect frequency of defect occurrences directly from manufacturing processes.",

  "q2": "What is a Pareto Diagram?",
  "a2": "A Pareto Diagram is a QC chart used to identify vital defect causes that contribute to 80% of quality problems.",

  "q3": "What is a Histogram?",
  "a3": "In industrial quality, a Histogram is used to visualize distribution of measurement data such as dimension, thickness, or tolerance deviation.",

  "q4": "How do I upload data from Excel?",
  "a4": "Click 'Upload Excel' and select a sheet containing columns for categories and counts.",

  "q5": "Is any production data stored?",
  "a5": "No. Your QC data never leaves your browser. Nothing is uploaded.",

  "q6": "Is this tool free for industry use?",
  "a6": "Yes. The platform is 100% free for engineering, industry, students, and research purposes.",

  "q7": "Is this tool usable on factory floor tablets?",
  "a7": "Yes. QC Tools is responsive and can be used on mobile or industrial touchscreen terminals."
